      <p id='intro'>Hi. This a web page dedicated to classic video games I love and grew up
      with!</p>
      <h2>Super Nintendo</h2>
      <p>The Super Nintendo (SNES for short) is the main game console I grew up
      playing as a kid. I have many great memories with it, which is not surprising
      as it is know as one of the best retro consoles from the 1990's. Some of the
      highlights of the system are Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link
      to the Past, and Final Fantasy 6 (released as FF 3 here in North America).
      These games are still highly playable today for their gameplay and story.</p>
